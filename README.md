# Scrapy FincaRaiz.

Vertical and horizontal scraping (with scrapy) on the fincaraiz page, extracting data from flats for rent. This data is cleaned and stored in a SQLite database. This process lasts for 2 minutes per page (30 items) approx, the difference with https://github.com/AdavidGuevara/airflow-fincaraiz is minimal.

**Note**: An example is provided from the city of Medell√≠n/Antioquia.
